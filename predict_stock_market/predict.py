#Conclusion: Here, we see that adding these additional features to the model does not improve its accuracy. 
# This is likely because it is basically impossible to meaningfully predict a major stock index such as the S&P 500 based only on the data we used in this model. 
# If it was possible to make such predictions, people would buy and sell based on them and the market would correct itself (see the Efficient Market Hypothesis).
